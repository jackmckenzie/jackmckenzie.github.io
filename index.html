                <p>The purpose of this retail software project was to allow administrative users to create and choose custom roles for users. They are able to create a user, assign them a role and a store and send them an activation email.</p>
                <p>I was the designer and front-end developer for this project, working with a product manager and back-end developer. I also wrote some back-end code in Django.</p>

                <p>Over the years I have become more and more passionate about accessibility. I believe adhering to accessibility standards improves rather than compromises designs. The current software I have been contributing to has many disparate components with poor accessibility used for form elements such as inputs, textareas, buttons etc, and this project was intended to have single TextInput, TextArea components that would handle aria labelling, html labelling with minimum effort from the developer.</p>

                <p>The user can also set flags such as Out of stock, on special, on clearance to show engaging promotions and information.</p>

                <p>The mobile scanner was created to help users in-store to replace missing tickets. Through customer feedback and interviews, we discovered that stores would often need to reprint their tickets outside of their usual print runs. This was typically achieved by writing down lengthy barcode numbers, by hand, to be manually entered into Last Yard. I led the design for this feature with a focus on providing speed and accuracy. We ran multiple sessions including extensive user interviews and prototype testing to learn how we could improve these processes and provide a better ticketing experience.</p>
