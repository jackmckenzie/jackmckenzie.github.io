                <p>Over the years I have become more and more passionate about accessibility. I believe adhering to accessibility standards improves rather than compromises design.</p>
                <p>The current software I have been contributing to has many disparate components with poor accessibility used for form elements such as inputs, textareas, buttons etc, and this project was intended to have single TextInput, TextArea components that would handle aria labelling, html labelling with minimum effort from the developer.</p>
                <p>I designed and created the components as we needed them, starting with Text Input, Text Area and a set of buttons.</p>

                <p>Proprietary web-based design software.</p>
                <p>This software is designed to allow users to create their own templates to print their paper promotional tickets.</p>
                <p>It was recognised that our old desktop-based software posed a business risk, as it was too difficult for clients to effectively use.</p>
                <p>I was heavily involved in this project from the outset, collaborating with a senior UX consultant on the initial UI. I then took on the role of sole designer and contributed front end code to the project, tidying up sidebar properties and adding some features.</p>

                  <li>I worked closely with our full-stack developers and was relied upon for questions about how things should work, look and feel</li>
                  <li>Designed smart groups: Similar to Flexbox and Figma&#39;s auto layout, these allow content to fill up remaining space when other content hasn&#39;t been filled in. In our legacy software, this was achieved with complex javascript code.</li>
                  <li>Designed complex price fields that allow a user to have fine control over how their dollar and cents symbols should look</li>

                <p>The mobile scanner was created to help users in-store to replace missing tickets. Through customer feedback and interviews, we discovered that stores would often need to reprint their tickets outside of their usual print runs. This was typically achieved by writing down lengthy barcode numbers, by hand, to be manually entered into Last Yard. I led the design for this feature with a focus on providing speed and accuracy. We ran multiple sessions including extensive user interviews and prototype testing to learn how we could improve these processes and provide a better ticketing experience.</p>
                <p>Customer feedback has been highly positive.</p>

                <p>Software for emergent retail systems.</p>
                <p>DSE is a custom screen that sits on the shelf, replacing the need to re-ticket the shelf.</p>
                <p>I designed and wrote a complex custom React template that takes the store&#39;s product data and populates the content on the screen.</p>
                <p>The software allows the user to set custom spacing based on product width and facings, to finetune how the layout should appear, and allows them to choose engaging promotions to show.</p>
                <p>*I&#39;m unable to include pictures due to privacy of the project.</p>
